Once a year, the Stranahan's distillery in Denver, Colo., releases its limited edition batch of whiskey called Snowflake. This batch is so coveted by locals that people sleep in the alley next to the distillery overnight in order to get a bottle of Snowflake. When a release in December 2013 coincided with a record cold snap where temperatures reached below zero, I camped out with the devoted in this first-person narrative.
