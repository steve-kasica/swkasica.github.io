Besides closing post offices, furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal employees, and delaying IRS refunds, the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 also rescinded rafting permits for the Grand Canyon issued during the lapse in funding. Groups of angry, locked-out rafters protested for days at the enterance to Lees Ferry.
