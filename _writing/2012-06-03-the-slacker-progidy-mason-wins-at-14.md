Being a runner, one of my beats at *The Vail Daily* was alternative sports, and I covered many events at the 2012 Teva Mountain games. Alex "The Machine" Mason from El Cerrito, Calif., won the first Gibbon Games International Competition on before a tight, cheering crowd in Vail Village. He pulled off the victory by outperforming older competitors from around the world, including 21-year-old Michael Payton, who was the 2011 world champion in this sport.
