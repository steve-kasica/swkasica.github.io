In 2017, Snap Inc. released Spectacles, a wearable sunglasses camera. But you could only get Spectalces through Snapbots that appeared somewhere in the United States for a day at roughly one-week intervals. Instead of checking the website everyday, I wrote a web-scraping program that emails users the minute when a new Snapbot appears with the actual address of the Snapbot by using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
