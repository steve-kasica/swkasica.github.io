In 2017, Snap Inc. released Spectacles, a wearable sunglasses camera. But, Spectalces were only sold through Snapbots that randomaly appeared somewhere in the United States for a day, at roughly one-week intervals. Instead religiously checking the Spectacles website, I wrote a web-scraping program that emails users the minute when a new Snapbot appears with the physical address using the Google Maps Geocoding API.
