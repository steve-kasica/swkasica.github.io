nutgraf: A Google Apps Script that publishes Strava activities as Medium stories.

Since high school, I've kept a running log that's served as my daily journal. In this age of GPS-enabled running watches, I still keep up with the log through my Strava profile. This Google Apps Script automagically publishes the text from the most popular entries every months as a post on Medium.
