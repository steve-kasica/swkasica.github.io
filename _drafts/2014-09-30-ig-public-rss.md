nutgraf: A Stack Overflow post addressing Instagram's sudden removal of their RSS feeds.
---

When Instagram suddenly removed its public RSS feeds in 2014 one of my applications stopped working. My post was the first on Stack Overflow to report it and troubleshoot replacements, since it was first published it has been viewed more than 12,000 times and gained protected status.
