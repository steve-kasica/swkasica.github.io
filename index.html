        <p>I'm currently pursuing a MSc in computer science at University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I work as a research assistant in Tamara Munzner's <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/group/infovis">InfoVis Group</a>. I came to computer science from journalism and my interests lie at the intersection of both.</p>

        <p>Before writing academic papers, I wrote features and news articles on issues in the American West, such as access to public lands, endurance sports, and whiskey. My byline has appear in: <em>Outside</em>, <em>The Vail Daily</em>, and <em>The New York Times</em>.</p>
        
        <p>I also logged a few years at the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Earth Systems Research Laboratory, where I built visualizations and web applications for meterologists and science communicators.</p>
