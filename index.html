    <p>I'm a software developer currently working on web services and data visualization projects within NOAA's Advanced Technology and Outreach branch. This is my personal website and includes a portfolio of my most recent <a href="/software-developer">software projects</a> and <a href="/floss-contributor">contributions I've made in the open-source community</a>. Before coming to software, I was in editorial journalism, and the <a href="/writer">clips page</a> contains a sample of my written work.</p>
